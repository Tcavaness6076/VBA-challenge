# VBA  (Visual Basic for Applications) Challenge
## Overview
In this homework we were tasked with creating VBA code in Excel to loop through multiple data sets containing over 1000 
individual data points. Our loop was to contain a pocess for scanning ticker symbols for each stock, yearly change from 
opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year for each stock and the total stock 
volume of each stock. It needed to do this and create a seperate table for each year containing those three data points, create
 a new column for the "Yearly Change" and color code the yearly change for a positive and negative change.
